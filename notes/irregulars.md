γινώσκω

first principle part may not be verb stem

> "For example, the verb stem of κηρύσσω (“I preach”) is not κηρυσσ-, but κηρυκ-. From κηρυκ- is formed the future κηρύξω by the rules given above (κηρυκ + σω = κηρύξω). Similarly, the verb stem of βαπτίζω (“I baptize”) is not βαπτιζ- but βαπτιδ-. From βαπτιδ- is formed the future βαπτίσω from the same rules (βαπτιδ + σω = βαπτίσω). In all these cases, amalgamation is said to have occurred."
